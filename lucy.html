        <p>
            Lucy has an actual birth certificate because sheâ€™s a posh girl! She came to live with us about 6 months ago from Wexford when her people had to downsize from 9 cats. I do love the drama of the silky black coats, but no one could argue that Lucy is not stunningly beautiful. She is a pedigree British Blue Shorthair, which in actuality means that she has quite long, fluffy fur in a beautiful grey - at least sheâ€™s still monochrome. We decided not to give her our double barreled surname, what with her being royalty and all, better to keep things simple. She still hasnâ€™t quite gotten used to Neo yet so she enjoys some time sleeping on her favourite chair most days, but sheâ€™s a hunter by night! She adores playing, she's so stealthy sheâ€™s almost silent and she would easily beat me in a short sprint. Lucy has significantly increased how much fluff there is in our living space. We brush her regularly and she produces enough fur to knit herself a full outfit. I have accepted that I am the cat lady and there will be a bit of cat hair on me most days, and thank goodness because one hug with Lucy necessitates a full outfit change otherwise. This is how her theme song was inspired. Sheâ€™s much better behaved than Neo so she gets to stay in our bedroom most nights and as she sleeps she occasionally makes the most adorable little snuffly noises because her nose is shorter than the average cat. This also means I have to wipe her eyes with lukewarm water to keep her comfortable. Lucy knows her mind and when she sees me with the tissue, she disappears like a flash. Weâ€™re so happy Lucy has joined us and we hope sheâ€™s having a great time.
