        <p>
            Neo is a contradiction. He is so full of life and joy and energy and rage and mischief and love ðŸ˜¹ When our older cat Evie passed away, Salem was lonely so we went to the rescue and spent ages looking for an older cat, but the place was coming down with kittens and all the older cats had conditions that meant they were staying in the rescue for life. Eventually, we came across Neo. At 6 months old, we thought heâ€™d be a perfect friend for sweet Salem - with 3 legs and an insatiable need for love and affection, he was ideal. For about 2 days. Since then, Neo has ruled the roost. He decides when we eat, play, rest and work. He has amazed me with his incredible determination to do anything his friends can do, despite having one back leg. We donâ€™t know if it was an accident or a congenital anomaly, but Neo certainly proves that a cat with 3 legs is not to be underestimated. He is happiest in my arms, being carried around and shown everything - heâ€™s very inquisitive. If my arms get tired, he has no issues galloping around at top speed or climbing up on whatever surface is available. His favourite tactic is to use his front legs to haul himself up. This can be a surprise when he has decided to do this to your leg or back - you have been warned. His current favourite activities are monopolising the computers by watching YouTube videos of birds or fish, and keeping watch from the high tower - these circles were originally designed to be a quiet space for Salem and Lucy, but in typical Neo fashion he was the 1st one to the top. He is named after the lead character from The Matrix, because he moves so fast.
